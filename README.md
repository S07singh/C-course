# C Programming Course

Welcome to the **C Programming Course**! This course is designed to take you from the fundamentals of C programming to advanced concepts, providing a solid foundation for programming and problem-solving.

## üìò Course Overview

The **C Programming Course** will cover essential topics in C, from basic syntax and data types to pointers, memory management, and file handling. By the end of this course, you‚Äôll be able to write efficient, optimized C code and have a strong grasp of core programming principles.

## üìù Prerequisites

- **Basic Computer Knowledge**: Familiarity with basic computer operations.
- **No Prior Coding Experience Required**: This course starts from the basics.
  
## üìö Course Outline

1. **Introduction to C**
   - Overview of the C language
   - Setting up your development environment (IDE or compiler)
   - Writing your first "Hello, World!" program

2. **Basic Syntax and Data Types**
   - Variables and data types (int, char, float, double)
   - Input and output (printf, scanf)
   - Operators and expressions

3. **Control Structures**
   - Conditional statements (if, if-else, switch)
   - Loops (for, while, do-while)
   - Introduction to break and continue

4. **Functions**
   - Function declaration, definition, and calling
   - Parameter passing and return values
   - Recursion and its applications

5. **Arrays and Strings**
   - Arrays: One-dimensional and multi-dimensional
   - String handling and manipulation
   - Common string functions in `<string.h>`

6. **Pointers**
   - Basics of pointers and memory addresses
   - Pointer arithmetic
   - Pointers with arrays, strings, and functions

7. **Structures and Unions**
   - Defining and using structures
   - Nested structures and arrays of structures
   - Introduction to unions and bit-fields

8. **File Handling**
   - Working with files: reading, writing, appending
   - File handling functions in `<stdio.h>`
   - Error handling with file operations

9. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
   - Understanding malloc, calloc, realloc, and free
   - Managing memory leaks
   - Using pointers for dynamic memory in arrays and structures

## üíª Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Install a C Compiler**: GCC (recommended), Clang, or Turbo C.
2. **Choose an IDE or Text Editor**:
   - For beginners: Code::Blocks, Dev C++
   - For advanced users: Visual Studio Code, Atom
3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and type:
     ```bash
     gcc --version
     ```
   - If GCC is installed, this should print the GCC version.

## üöÄ How to Start
